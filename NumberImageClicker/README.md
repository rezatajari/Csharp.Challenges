# Challenge 15 – Number Image Clicker (Windows Form)

### Concept

This challenge focuses on **Windows Forms UI interaction**, event handling, and linking **visual elements to program logic**.
You’ll create an interactive application where **clicking images triggers actions**, reinforcing how PictureBox controls can respond to user input.

### The Challenge

1. Create a **Windows Form** application.
2. Add **five PictureBox controls**, each displaying a different number image (1–5).
3. For each PictureBox, implement a **click event handler** that displays a `MessageBox` showing the word corresponding to the image number:

| Image | Display Message |
| ----- | --------------- |
| 1     | one             |
| 2     | two             |
| 3     | three           |
| 4     | four            |
| 5     | five            |

4. Ensure the **click event works for each image independently**.
5. Test the application to confirm that **clicking any image shows the correct word**.

**Example Behavior:**

* User clicks the image for 1 → MessageBox shows `one`
* User clicks the image for 3 → MessageBox shows `three`

### Why This Matters

This exercise teaches you how to:

* Use **PictureBox controls** to display images in WinForms.
* Handle **click events** for multiple controls.
* Connect **UI elements to program logic**.
* Provide **interactive, visual feedback** to users.
