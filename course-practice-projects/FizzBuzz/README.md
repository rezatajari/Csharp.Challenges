# Challenge 11 – FizzBuzz

### Concept

FizzBuzz is one of the most famous beginner programming problems, often used in interviews.
It teaches the fundamentals of **loops, conditional statements, and modular arithmetic**.

Instead of just printing numbers, you apply rules to transform certain values into meaningful outputs.

### The Challenge

1. Write a program that displays integers from **1 to 100**.
2. For numbers divisible by **3**, display `"Fizz"` instead of the number.
3. For numbers divisible by **5**, display `"Buzz"` instead of the number.
4. For numbers divisible by **both 3 and 5**, display `"FizzBuzz"`.
5. All other numbers should be displayed normally.

**Example Output (partial):**

```
1  
2  
Fizz  
4  
Buzz  
Fizz  
7  
8  
Fizz  
Buzz  
11  
Fizz  
13  
14  
FizzBuzz  
...
```

### Why This Matters

This exercise helps you practice:

* **Loops** to iterate through ranges of numbers.
* **Conditionals** to apply multiple rules.
* **Modulo (%) operator** to detect divisibility.
* Clean code structure, since this problem is often a benchmark for readability.
