# Latin Translator (Windows Form)

### Concept

This challenge focuses on **Windows Forms application development**, user interaction, and event handling.
You’ll build a simple **translator tool** that demonstrates how GUI elements (buttons, labels) interact with code to provide meaningful feedback to users.

### The Challenge

1. Create a **Windows Form** application.
2. Add **three buttons**, each representing a Latin word:

   * `sinister`
   * `dexter`
   * `medium`
3. Add a **Label control** to display the translation.
4. When the user clicks a button, the **label should display the English translation**:

   | Latin    | English |
   | -------- | ------- |
   | sinister | left    |
   | dexter   | right   |
   | medium   | center  |
5. Ensure the application is responsive and **updates the label correctly** for each click.

**Example Behavior:**

* User clicks `sinister` → Label shows `left`
* User clicks `dexter` → Label shows `right`
* User clicks `medium` → Label shows `center`

### Why This Matters

This exercise teaches you how to:

* Work with **Windows Forms controls** (Button, Label).
* Handle **button click events**.
* Connect **UI elements to program logic**.
* Provide **interactive feedback** to users in a desktop application.
