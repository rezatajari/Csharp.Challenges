# Valid Values and Frequency Counter  

### Concept  
Imagine you are collecting survey responses where people rate something on a scale from **0 to 10**.  
Not everyone enters valid numbers — some might mistype or give answers outside the allowed range.  

We need a way to:  
- Count how many valid responses we received.  
- Count how many invalid responses we received.  
- See the **distinct valid values** and how often each was chosen.  

This is the same as how businesses, schools, or apps analyze rating data.  

### The Challenge  
1. Read data into an array of integers.  
2. Only values in the range **0–10** are considered valid.  
3. Display:  
   - The **number of valid entries**.  
   - The **number of invalid entries**.  
   - A list of distinct valid values and how many times each appears.  
4. Use this test data to check your program:  1 7 2 4 2 3 8 4 6 4 4 7


### Why This Matters  
This exercise teaches how to:  
- Work with **arrays** to store data.  
- Separate **valid vs invalid values**.  
- Count **frequencies of distinct numbers**.  

Think of it as building a **mini statistics tool** — turning raw input into organized results that reveal patterns.
