# Challenge 03 – Random Numbers Analysis  

### Concept  
Random numbers are used everywhere: games, simulations, testing, and even security.  
But raw numbers aren’t very useful until we **analyze them**.  

This challenge is about generating a bunch of numbers and **finding meaningful insights**:  
- How many are odd numbers?  
- Which is the smallest number?  
- Which is the largest number?  

### The Challenge  
1. Generate **1000 random numbers** between `0` and `100000`.  
2. Analyze the numbers to determine:  
   - Count of **odd numbers**.  
   - The **smallest value**.  
   - The **largest value**.  
3. Display the results in a **Windows message box**.  

### Why This Matters  
This exercise teaches:  
- How to **generate random numbers** in C#.  
- How to **scan a list** to extract statistics.  
- How to **interact with users** via a simple graphical interface (message box).  

Think of it as a **mini data analysis tool** — the code models the process, but the concept is about turning raw data into understandable information.
