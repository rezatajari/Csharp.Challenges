# Challenge 12 – Lo Shu Magic Square

### Concept

The **Lo Shu Magic Square** is a 3×3 grid where:

* Each row, column, and diagonal adds up to 15.
* Each number from 1 through 9 appears exactly once.

This challenge focuses on **randomization, array manipulation, and logic validation**.
Instead of manually entering numbers, the program **shuffles numbers** randomly until a magic square is formed, teaching concepts like **loops, 2D arrays, and boolean validation**.

### The Challenge

1. Initialize a **3×3 matrix** with numbers 1–9.
2. Randomly **switch cells** in the matrix until it becomes a Lo Shu Magic Square.
3. Count and display the **number of shuffles** it took.
4. Display the **final magic square**.
5. Ensure your program uses:

   * A method to **display the board**.
   * A method to **check if the board is a magic square**.
   * A method to **switch two random cells**.

**Example Output:**

```
It took 2345 tries.
4 9 2
3 5 7
8 1 6
```

### Why This Matters

This exercise helps you practice:

* **2D arrays** and indexing.
* **Randomization and shuffling** techniques.
* **Boolean logic** and validation checks.
* **Loops** for repeated trials until a condition is met.
* Displaying results in a **structured and readable format**.
