# Card Name Display (Windows Form)

### Concept

This challenge focuses on **Windows Forms interaction** with images and labels.
You’ll learn to **link visual elements to program logic** and display dynamic information based on user actions.

### The Challenge

1. Create a **Windows Form** application.
2. Add **five PictureBox controls**, each displaying a **different card image**.
3. Add a **Label control** to display the card name.
4. For each PictureBox, implement a **click event** that updates the label with the **name of the clicked card**.
5. Ensure the program responds correctly for **any card clicked**.

**Example Behavior:**

* User clicks the PictureBox showing the Ace of Spades → Label displays `Ace of Spades`
* User clicks the PictureBox showing the King of Hearts → Label displays `King of Hearts`

### Why This Matters

This exercise teaches you how to:

* Use **PictureBox controls** to display images.
* Handle **click events** for multiple controls.
* Update a **Label dynamically** based on user actions.
* Connect **UI elements to program logic** for interactive applications.
