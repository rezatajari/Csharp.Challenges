# Challenge 05 – Custom Multiplication Table  

### Concept  
Multiplication tables are one of the first tools we use to learn math.  
Instead of being fixed (like the usual 1–10 times table), this challenge creates a **dynamic table** where the user decides the starting and ending numbers.  

It’s not just about multiplying — it’s about **building flexible programs** that adjust to user input while keeping results structured and easy to read.  

### The Challenge  
1. Ask the user for two inputs:  
   - **First base value**  
   - **Last base value**  
   (Allowed range: 2–8)  
2. Build a multiplication table with **25 rows** and a column for each base value.  
   - The **first row** should be 1 × each base.  
   - The **last row** should be 25 × each base.  
3. If the user enters an invalid base (outside 2–8), show an **error message**.  
4. Display the table in a clean, **aesthetically formatted** way so it’s easy to read.  

### Why This Matters  
This exercise teaches how to:  
- Use **loops** to generate structured outputs.  
- Accept **user input** and validate it.  
- Format results so they’re not just correct, but also **readable**.  

Think of this as building your own **customizable multiplication chart**, where the computer does all the work of aligning and calculating.
