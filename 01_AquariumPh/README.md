# Challenge 01 – Aquarium pH Health Check  

### Concept  
Imagine you are taking care of an aquarium.  
Fish depend on the right water conditions to stay healthy, and one of the most important factors is **pH level**.  

- **pH 7** → Neutral water (safe balance for most freshwater fish).  
- **pH lower than 7** → Acidic water (can stress or harm fish if too low).  
- **pH higher than 7** → Alkaline water (can also cause stress if too high).  

### The Challenge  
We want a small program where the user enters the **pH level number** of their aquarium.  
The program should then tell them whether their aquarium is:  
- **Acidic**  
- **Neutral**  
- **Alkaline**  

### Why This Matters  
This challenge is not just about numbers — it connects programming to real-life care for living creatures.  
By solving it, you learn how to:  
- Take input from a user.  
- Compare values with conditions.  
- Provide clear, meaningful feedback.  

Think of the code as your **digital water test kit**.
