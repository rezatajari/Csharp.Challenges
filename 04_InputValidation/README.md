# Challenge 04 – Input Validation Loop  

### Concept  
In real-world applications, users don’t always give us the data we expect.  
Sometimes they type letters when we need numbers, or numbers that are too big or too small.  

This challenge focuses on **handling user input gracefully**.  
Instead of crashing or producing wrong results, the program should **check the input** and respond appropriately.  

### The Challenge  
1. Create a program that repeatedly asks the user to enter a number.  
2. Only **positive integers less than 100** are considered valid.  
3. The program should keep track of:  
   - **Valid entries**  
   - **Invalid entries** (including non-numeric input)  
4. When the user finishes entering data, display the counts of **valid** and **invalid** entries.  

### Why This Matters  
This exercise teaches:  
- How to **use loops** to repeatedly prompt for input.  
- How to **validate data** before processing it.  
- How to **handle errors** like non-numeric input.  

Think of this as building a **smart gatekeeper**: only correct data passes through, and the program keeps track of everything else.
