# Challenge 07 – Realty Sales Percentage Report

### Concept

In business, it’s often not enough to know **just the totals** — understanding **contributions of individual entries** gives insight into performance trends.

This challenge focuses on **handling dynamic input**, **calculating totals**, and **computing percentages**.

### The Challenge

1. Ask the user for **the number of monthly sales values** they want to enter.
2. Prompt the user to enter each **monthly sales amount** (any positive number).
3. Calculate the **total of all sales**.
4. Display a **report** with:

   * The original value entered for each month.
   * The **percentage** each value contributes to the total.

**Example Output:**

| Month | Sales Amount | % of Total |
| ----- | ------------ | ---------- |
| 1     | 5000         | 25%        |
| 2     | 15000        | 75%        |
| Total | 20000        | 100%       |

5. **Input Validation:**

   * Reject negative numbers or invalid input.
   * Prompt again if input is invalid.

### Why This Matters

This exercise teaches you how to:

* Handle **dynamic user input**.
* Use **lists/arrays** to store multiple values.
* Perform **percentage calculations** relative to a total.
* Display **structured, readable reports**.
